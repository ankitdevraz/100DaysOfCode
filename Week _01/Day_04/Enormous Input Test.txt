Question :

The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

Input
The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k<=107). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer ti, not greater than 109, each.

Output
Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers ti are divisible by k.

Example
Input:
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11

Output:
4



Solution : 



import java.util.Scanner;

class Salary {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

       int a=sc.nextInt();
       int b=sc.nextInt();
       int arr[]=new int[a];
       int  count=0;
       for(int i=0; i<a; i++){
           arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
       if(arr[i]%b==0){
           count++;
       }
       }
       System.out.println(count);

    }


}
