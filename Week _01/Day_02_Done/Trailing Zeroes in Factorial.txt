Solution: 

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Write your code here
 Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num =s.nextInt();
        int numFives=0;
        int currentPow=5;
        while(currentPow<=num){
            numFives += num/currentPow;
            currentPow=currentPow*5;

        }
        System.out.println(numFives);
	}
}
