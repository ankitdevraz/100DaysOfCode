Question : 

Input

The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N = 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game. Lines 2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds. Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1 and 2 respectively, in round i. You may assume that 1 = Si = 1000 and 1 = Ti = 1000.

Output

Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the maximum lead attained by the winner.

Example

Input:

5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90
Output:

1 58


Solution: 



import java.util.Scanner;

class Salary {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        int a=0,b=0,l=0,p=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            int a1=sc.nextInt();
            int b1=sc.nextInt();
            a+=a1;
            b+=b1;
            if(a>b&&a-b>l)
            {
                l=a-b;
                p=1;
            }
            else if(b>a&&b-a>l)
            {
                l=b-a;
                p=2;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(p+" "+l);
    }
