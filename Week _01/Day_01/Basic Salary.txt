Q :
Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    
	totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.

Sample Input 1 :
10000 A
Sample Output 1 :
17600

Sample Input 2 :
4567 B
Sample Output 2 :
8762

Solution:


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int basicSalary = sc.nextInt();
        char Grade = sc.next().charAt(0);

        double hra = .2 * basicSalary;
        double da = .5* basicSalary;

        int allow;
        if (Grade == 'A') {    
            allow = 1700;
        } else if (Grade == 'B') {
            allow = 1500;
        } else {
            allow=1300;
        }

        double pf = .11 * basicSalary;

        double totalSalary = basicSalary + hra + da + allow - pf;
        int ans= (int) Math.round(totalSalary);
        System.out.println(ans);


    }
}
